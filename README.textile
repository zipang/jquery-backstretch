h1. jQuery Backstretch

Backstretch is a jQuery plugin that allows you to add a dynamically-resized background image to any page.
The image will stretch to fit the page, and will automatically resize as the window size changes.

h2. Demo

There are a couple of examples included with this package, or feel free to check it out live "on the project page itself.":http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/

h2. Options

h3. centeredX

The ratio of the width/height of the image doesn't always jive with the width/height of the window. This parameter controls whether or not we center the image on the X axis to account for the discrepancy. (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. centeredY

This parameter controls whether or not we center the image on the Y axis to account for the aforementioned discrepancy. (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. stretchX

This parameter controls whether we should occupy the full screen width or not. If not, we only stretch the image vertically (better to display images in portrait). (type=Boolean, default=true)

h3. speed

This is the speed at which the image will fade in, after downloading is complete. Integers are accepted, as well as standard jQuery speed strings (slow, normal, fast). (type=Integer, default=0)

h3. transition

Supply a new transition function that takes the following parameters (image, speed, oldies, callback).
Where :
    - image is the new (currently invisible) image to display
    - speed is the current setting for the speed of the transition
    - oldies is the old image. This transition function SHOULD remove the old image after the transition is finished.
    - callback. The transition function MUST call this callback function if supplied after the transition's end.

h2. Setup

Include the jQuery library and Backstretch plugin files in your webpage (preferably at the bottom of the page, before the closing BODY tag):

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery.backstretch.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

Note: The example above uses the Google hosted version of jQuery.

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $.backstretch("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
</script>
</code></pre>

Want to change the image after Backstretch has been loaded? No problem, just call it again!

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
  $.backstretch("/path/to/image.jpg", {speed: 150});
  
  // Perhaps you'd like to change the image on a button click
  $(".button").click(function() {
      $.backstretch("/path/to/next_image.jpg");
  });
</script>
</code></pre>

h2. Changelog

h3. Version 1.3

* Fully refactored version.
* Added support for custom transitions.
* Added the stretch parameter to choose between 'full' or '' stretch

h3. Version 1.2

* You can now call backstretch() on the same element, and it will replace the existing image.

h3. Version 1.1

* Added 'centeredX' and 'centeredY' options.
* Removed 'hideUntilReady' option. It looks pretty bad if you don't hide the image until it's fully loaded.
* Fixed IE img onload bug.
* Now supports iPhone/iPad orientation changes.
